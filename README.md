In the navbar i added the navigate functionality to move to contact form

- to take form value i used `useReducer Hook`
- Once user click on submit it will show a login status to achieve that i used toast component from chakra ui

-I've also added the functionality of scroll down to change the color of nav link

## Landing Page

- On Main Landing i've added the video using a library name `react iframe` to achieve this.
